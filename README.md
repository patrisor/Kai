2. **Generate an API Key**:
   - Navigate to the API section and create a new API key with the necessary permissions.

3. **Store Your API Key**:
   - Keep your API key secure. You'll need to input it when you first run Kai.

#### Setting Up Google Cloud API Credentials

To enable speech-to-text and text-to-speech features:

1. **Download the Service Account File**:
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Navigate to **IAM & Admin** > **Service Accounts**.
   - Select or create a service account with the necessary permissions for both the **Cloud Text-to-Speech API** and **Cloud Speech-to-Text API**.
   - Click **Manage Keys** > **Add Key** > **Create New Key**.
   - Choose **JSON** and click **Create** to download the file.

2. **Move the File to the `.config` Directory**:
   - Place the downloaded JSON file in the `.config` directory within your `kai` project folder.

### Step 2: Installation

After completing the API setup, proceed with the following steps to install and run Kai.

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/patrisor/kai.git
   cd kai
   ```

2. **Build and Run**:
   ```sh
   go build && ./kai
   ```

**Important**: Do not attempt to build or run the application until you have completed the API setup, including obtaining your Gemini API key and setting up your Google Cloud API credentials.
